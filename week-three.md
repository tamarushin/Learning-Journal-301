This week feels insane. I am getting closer and closer to understanding code but it is so fast paced, I feel dizzy. I worked with Izzy on Sunday and we are working together on Friday and Saturday so I feel confident I will get all my resubmits in. I also feel comfortable about the 401 entrance exam as I did really well on all of the quizzes. I understand the concepts, I am just squeeky on implementing code. Brian and Taylor have been INCREDIBLE taking the time to go over all of the building of the code. I am working on the html and css side of things as I feel a bit stronger there. Last night we went to a womans meetup at Facebook and it was SO exciting! Gorgeous place and very friendly people there. It definatly got me motivated to go back to work and be in that environment again. I spent most of my time recruiting for CF and even got two women who are going to take 101! I also have felt better since my meltdown last week because I have been asking my fellow classmates if they have had previous experience in coding and every single one I asked said yes. Working in the industry between 5-10 years. A lot of them in technical support. I gave myself a few kudos for starting off by scratch. This dream is looking more like a reality slowly but surely! I appreciate Brian for ALWAYS having my back and pushing me to do better.
