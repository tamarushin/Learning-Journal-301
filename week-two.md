# I am feeling the pressure of needing to be able to write readable and workable code.
# I have a tutor and I have been practicing at night. I have accepted this may take me longer to digest than maybe my whole class but I have to keep reminding myself that this is really new and really hard. Tomorrow I work with Christian on paired programming. So far, all of my partners have been the drivers and I ask him if it was ok for me to drive so I could feel confident about understanding the task. He of course said no problem so I am excited for tomorrows lab. I know if I just keep pushing forward and showing up, I will eventually get this and be an excellent developer.
